Genesis 1–3: A Storytelling Series
(Narration-Only Script with Cues)

Part 1: Creation – “And God Saw That It Was Good”
🎵 Music: Expansive, awe-inspiring orchestral rise
 🎙️ Narrator (calm, reverent tone):
 “In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. Darkness covered the deep… but then—God said, ‘Let there be light.’ And there was light.”
 [pause 2s]
“With His word, the skies stretched wide, the seas parted, and the land appeared. Stars burned in the night, plants covered the ground, birds filled the air, and creatures moved across the land.”
 [pause 2s]
“Last of all, God formed humanity in His image—male and female He created them. He blessed them, saying: ‘Be fruitful, fill the earth, and care for it.’”
 [pause 3s]
🎵 Music swells gently
 “And God saw all that He had made, and it was very good. On the seventh day, He rested. Creation was complete, and peace filled the earth.”
 [pause 4s]

Part 2: Life in Eden – “The Gift and the Command”
🎵 Music: Gentle, serene strings with sounds of water flowing
 🎙️ Narrator:
 “God planted a garden in Eden—lush, alive, and overflowing with beauty. Rivers flowed, trees bore fruit, and in the middle stood two: the tree of life, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.”
 [pause 2s]
“The Lord placed the man there to work and care for the garden. And He gave this command: ‘You may eat freely from any tree… but not from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. For if you eat from it, you will surely die.’”
 [pause 3s]
“Seeing the man alone, God created the woman as his companion. And the two became one flesh. They lived in perfect harmony—with each other, with creation, and with God. Naked… yet unashamed.”
 [pause 4s]

Part 3: The Fall and Exile – “From Shame to Hope”
🎵 Music: Subtle tension, low strings
 🎙️ Narrator:
 “But the serpent was cunning. It whispered: ‘Did God really say you must not eat from this tree?’ The fruit was pleasing to the eye, desirable for wisdom. The woman took and ate. She gave some to her husband, and he ate also.”
 [pause 2s]
🎵 Music: Sudden dissonant tone
 “Then their eyes were opened. Shame flooded in. They saw their nakedness, and they hid from the Lord among the trees.”
 [pause 2s]
“God called: ‘Where are you?’ The man blamed the woman. The woman blamed the serpent. Judgment fell: the serpent cursed to crawl, the woman to bear pain, the man to labor until he returned to dust. Yet even in judgment… hope was spoken: one day, the offspring of the woman would crush the serpent’s head.”
 [pause 4s]
🎵 Music: Somber but gently rising with hope
 “In mercy, God clothed them with garments of skin. But the gates of Eden closed, guarded by a flaming sword. Humanity walked east of Eden—carrying sorrow, but also carrying a promise. For one day, redemption would come.”
